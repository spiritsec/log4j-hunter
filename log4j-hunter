# locally installed packages (Slackware, OpenWrt, and others)
# 
# Its exit code system have been designed to help you to use in 
# automations, checking following values
# 0 - No log4j packages or java detected
# 1 - Log4j packages found 
# 2 - No log4j packages found, but java found (jar/war/ear)

# Detect system (deb, yum, zypper, pacman)
